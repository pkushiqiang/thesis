\section{Machine learning and Rule-based IE technologies}

There are two kinds of competitive techniques in Information Extraction, one is machine learning-based approaches, the other is rule-based approaches. Chiticariu et al. \cite{chiticariu2013rule} summarized the pros and cons of machine learning (ML) and rule-based IE technologies in Table \ref{tab:mlrb}.

In this work, we prefer the rule-based approach because:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Most of sentences that contain the information share some common patterns that can be easily identified.
    \item A lot of sentences are not grammatical completed as a sentence, for example some of them missing subject, and some of them are just a list of terms.
    \item Processing speed is also a concern, and generally rule-based approach is faster.
\end{enumerate}
