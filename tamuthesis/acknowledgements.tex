\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.


\indent My greatest thanks to the members of the Sketch Recognition Lab for their
continued support and help in the research work covered in this thesis. This thesis
would not have been possible without their support. In addition, I would like to give
extra thanks to my advisor Dr. Tracy Hammond, as well as to my committee members
Dr. Anxiao Jiang and Dr. Daniel W. Goldberg for their valuable sage advice.
